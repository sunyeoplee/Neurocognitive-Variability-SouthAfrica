# Neurocognitive-Variability-SouthAfrica

We examined the differential variability of various neurocognitive outcomes by childhood trauma in South African women. To model the variance, we ran complex level-1 variance model. This model is a multilevel model in which level-1 variance is modelled by level-1 variable. Here, neurocognitive outcomes are modelled by a continuous meausre of childhood trauma severity. All codes were run in R. For the complex level-1 variance models, R2MLwiN package was used in R to run MLwiN within R. 

## Installation 
[R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) - a programming language  
[MLwiN](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/software/mlwin/download/) - a specialized software for multilevel modeling

## Analytic framework
### Complex level-1 variance model: 
this model is an extension of a multilevel model, which commonly models variance at higher levels than level-1. Complex level-1 variance model adds random effects at level-1 variance. It explicitly models level-1 variance instead of assuming homoscedasticity. It assesses whether variance of an outcome varies by a covariate.
